# Building a Traffic Light with Raspberry Pi: Beginner's workshop

Participants learn to switch on LEDs in a sequence to simulate a traffic light, and later connect a button and a pedestrian light. Pressing the button simulates pressing a pedestrian crossing button, where the traffic light cycles to red and the pedestrian light turns on, signaling it is okay to cross. 

This workshop was first held at GDG and WTM Brunei's Road to DevFest event on the 18th October 2019
